Notes for CS 201

-Arguments are anything extra data supplied to the command line distinguished by a space. “” allows space to be in single argument. 
-l is a flag that stands for long list mode.


# Absolute Path
- is identified with slash.


- Tricky exception:
~		-The Shell replaces the tilde with the home dir BEFORE the command is run. 
$HOME		-ditto
~username  	-ditto but for a particular user.


# Relative Paths
-relative path does not have slash. Which means its relative to the current working directory.

-They are RELATIVE to the terminal's current working directory (in most cases).


# Environment Variables

-Used by specifying a '$' character followed by the name

-Can be listed with the 'env' command.
